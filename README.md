# 🍃 Calm Tabs

## ⚡ Overview
**Calm Tabs** is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your study or work environment by managing audio playback across multiple browser tabs. When you are watching a video in one tab, this extension automatically pauses the music playing in another tab to ensure an uninterrupted focus experience. Once you stop the video, the music resumes, providing a seamless and distraction-free environment.

Its like having a personal DJ who knows when to stop!


## 🧠 How it works

1. **Music Tab Identification**

- Hit that magical button in the extension popup to mark a tab as your “Music Tab.” Think of it as giving your music a VIP pass.
- This tab will be watched over like a hawk—any video that plays on other tabs will trigger a musical pause.

2. **Video State Spy**

- Calm Tabs is always on the lookout for videos that start playing. When it sees one, it whispers to your music tab, “Shh, the video’s on!”
- When the video gets bored and pauses, it gives the green light for the music to resume, ensuring your jams are only paused for as long as the video is.
